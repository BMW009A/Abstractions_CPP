# Repo of Programming Abstractions in C++
### This repo contains the code examples in the textbook and also some important points.
## Chapter 2 (Random.h Interface Design)
The interface design has five principles:
1. __Unified__: An interface should define a consistent abstraction with a clear unifying
theme. If a function does not fit that theme, it should be defined elsewhere.
2. __Simple__: 
3. __Sufficient__:
4. __General__:
5. __Stable__:

Project contains :RandTest.cpp, random.cpp and random.h.
